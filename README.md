My first application built using Webpack. Just a simple Weather app which tracks your current location (if you'll allow) and shows your current weather and forecasts for the next 5 days. Also, you can provide city, country and region (this is optional, but sometimes it's better to provide it to exclude other locations with the same name) and receive current weather and forecasts for this place.
Used getCurrentPosition method to track current's user location and APIs from "https://positionstack.com" (to receive coordinates) and "https://www.weatherapi.com" (weather and forecast).
Also, you can change background theme using list of themes in the right-bottom corner.
